<p> If you want to go to for more sexy look then a backless wedding dress is for you. This style shows off your whole back and give you a look that is daring. People are sometimes hesitant for this because it may be too scandalous. If you keep the front of the dress more elegant and conservative then the back will balance it out. This backless style has become a popular trend for younger people however any age can rock this look. Just make sure that it is a good fit to your back; we dont want anything hanging loose. </p>

<p> If you want something flirty then the off the shoulder look is for you. This style looks good on all age groups however if you are older then I recomend this look. It is perfect because it doesnt reveal too much. You can get just the right amount of skin showing. It could be a great style if you do not want to be worried about pulling it up constantly. This style will also look great with a updo because showing your shoulders is a great way to add some edge.

<p>Here is a elegant dress. If want to look more elegant and less sexy then find a dress with less lace and more white. White make you seem like you look like a pearl which in the end makes you look amazing. Everyone appreciates an elegant dress. You can not go wrong. This style is usually accompanied by tight fit. Therefore if you do not want your dress to hug your curves then go with a different style. </p>

<p>If are having a small wedding and dont want to spend thousands on your dress then a simple dress is the way to go. A simple dress will also be the cheapest out there. The more jewels on the dress then the more expessive it is. Going with an simple dress ensure the best price and a great look. If you are going to go simple then everything else must be simple too, be consistent. Therefore your hair should be down and your makeup natural. If you want to add more fun to your look, a flower head piece would look great. </p>

<img src="images/strapless.jpg" class="strapless" alt="strapless dress">
<p> A strapless dress will always be the go-to style. This is not neccessarily a bad thing if you are not trying to be extravagent. This dress is perfect for a pretty but simple look. If you are going with this look then you have to consider breast size. This is because you do not want to keep pulling up your dress while you walk. One important thing while deciding a wedding dress is that it should be comfortable. Who would want to be unfortable on their wedding day?
