<p> If you want to go to for more sexy look then a backless wedding dress is for you. This style shows off your whole back and give you a look that is daring. People are sometimes hesitant for this because it may be too scandalous, however if you keep the front of the dress more elegant and conservative then the backless portion will balance it out. This backless style has become a popular trend for younger people however any age can rock this look. Just make sure that it is a good fit to your back; we dont want anything hanging loose. </p>
