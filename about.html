<h1> ABOUT THE <img src="images/blog.png" alt="blog" class="blog"></h1>
<hr/>
<p> I created this blog to help future brides find their perfect dress and to get a little insight into what they want to style their wedding. I personally have an obsession with wedding dresses and have my dress already planned out.I have also been searching for the decorations, the location, and the makeup. A day like this only happens once and the more time that is put into planning, the better the day will be. Everyone is unique in style put everyone should have the opportunity to look beautiful at their own wedding</p>
